# Landscape calculator (battle HUD) — design

**Date:** 2026-07-07
**Status:** Approved
**Reference design:** Claude Design project "Arena VGC Design System" (f20e187b-0c82-44ce-879c-8c25a14c2906), `ui_kits/arena-app/landscape.html` + `CalculatorLandscape.jsx` — the approved landscape mock.

## Problem

Pokémon Champions is played in landscape. Today the app has no orientation
handling at all: `useIsMobile` is `(max-width: 767px)` only, so a phone rotated
to landscape (e.g. 800×360) falls out of the mobile branch and renders the
**desktop** layout crammed into 360px of height. Mid-battle use — the app's
core moment — is exactly when the layout is worst.

## Goal

Port the approved landscape mock into the app: a three-panel battle HUD
(attacker | result | defender) shown when a phone- or iPad-mini-sized viewport
is in landscape orientation, at full mock fidelity (per-move damage in the move
list, Damage ↔ Speed center-column toggle, scenario rows). Calculator only;
other tabs show a "Rotate to portrait" placeholder in landscape.

## Decisions made during brainstorm

| Question | Decision |
|---|---|
| Which work stream | Landscape calculator in-app (before finishing player-team-scan tasks or Android floating capture) |
| Screens in scope | Calculator only; Teams / EV-SP / Speed tiers get a rotate-to-portrait placeholder |
| Trigger | Size-based: landscape orientation up to iPad-mini size; desktop unaffected |
| V1 fidelity | Full mock: three panels + per-move % + Speed compare mode + scenario rows |
| Architecture | Approach A: third presentational tree beside the existing portrait `ArenaCalculator`, gated by a viewport-mode hook; state stays shared at page level |

## 1. Viewport gating

New hook `useViewportMode(): 'desktop' | 'arena' | 'arena-landscape'` in
`src/hooks/useViewportMode.ts`, following the `matchMedia` subscribe pattern of
`useIsMobile.ts`:

- `arena-landscape` = `(orientation: landscape) and (max-height: 767px)`.
  Covers phones (≤ ~460px tall in landscape) and iPad mini (744px tall in
  landscape). iPad Air (820px tall) and larger stay desktop. Takes precedence
  over the portrait check.
- `arena` = current `(max-width: 767px)` behavior (portrait mobile).
- `desktop` = everything else.

Migrate all six `useIsMobile` call sites to the new hook:
`src/components/templates/Layout.tsx`, `src/pages/DamageCalculator/index.tsx`,
`src/pages/Teams/index.tsx`, `src/pages/TeamDetail/index.tsx`,
`src/pages/EvSpConverter/index.tsx`, `src/pages/SpeedTierList/index.tsx`.
`useIsMobile` is then unused and is deleted along with its test (superseded by
`useViewportMode` tests).

Per-mode rendering:

| Mode | Layout shell | Calculator page | Other 4 pages |
|---|---|---|---|
| `desktop` | desktop header/footer | desktop template | desktop UIs |
| `arena` | `ArenaShell` (app bar + tab bar) | `ArenaCalculator` | existing Arena mobile UIs |
| `arena-landscape` | `ArenaShell` rail variant | `ArenaCalculatorLandscape` | `RotateToPortrait` placeholder |

**Accepted edge:** a deliberately short desktop browser window (e.g. 1300×700)
also gets the battle HUD. Height + orientation is the simple, testable rule;
no pointer/touch sniffing.

## 2. Shell: nav rail variant

`ArenaShell` gains a landscape mode (single component, not a second shell — its
tab/route/title maps and RegPill menu are shell-agnostic and would otherwise be
duplicated):

- Outer flex flips to `row`.
- New `NavRail` component (~30 lines, `src/design-system/arena/NavRail.tsx`)
  reusing `ARENA_TABS` + `Icon`: app mark at top, four icon tabs (44px targets,
  active = accent + accent-soft fill), spacer, `ThemeToggle`, compact `RegPill`
  at the bottom. Width ~56px. `RegPill` gains a `compact` prop rendering only
  the short code (e.g. "M-B") so it fits the rail; menu behavior unchanged.
- **No AppBar in landscape** — the rail carries mark/theme/reg; all 360px of
  height goes to content.
- The RegPill menu re-anchors in landscape (current anchor math assumes the
  app bar): anchored to the rail's bottom-left edge instead. The `inset: 0`
  click-away scrim behavior is unchanged.

## 3. Landscape calculator tree

New `src/features/damage-calculator/components/mobile/ArenaCalculatorLandscape.tsx`
rendered by `DamageCalculator/index.tsx` in `arena-landscape` mode, receiving
the **identical props** as portrait `ArenaCalculator`: `state`, `dispatch`,
`pokemonList`, `moveList`, `p1Results`, `p2Results`, `p1MaxHp`, `p2MaxHp`,
`actions`, `onApplySpread`, `onResetBuild`, `onOpenScan`,
`attackerExtra` (MyTeamChips), `defenderExtra` (OpponentRosterChips).
`ScanTeamModal` and `ToastNotification` remain page-level siblings.

Three independently scrolling panels (hidden scrollbars), per the mock:

- **Attacker (left, ~240px):** ATTACKER micro-label + "You" badge;
  `attackerExtra` chips; sprite/name/types identity; move list (4 slots, see
  §4); Ability + Item select rows; Nature / SP / Rank tune boxes (read-only
  summary; tapping opens the Advanced sheet).
- **Center (flex):** Damage ↔ Speed segmented toggle + swap-direction button;
  matchup line ("Moonblast · X vs Y"); damage view = % readout + KO verdict +
  roll band + scenario rows + field chips row; speed view = your effective
  speed + scarf/tailwind chips + rank stepper vs opponent tier list with
  Faster/Outsped/Tie badges; Advanced action at the bottom.
- **Defender (right, ~240px):** DEFENDER micro-label + "Opponent" badge;
  `defenderExtra` chips + scan button; identity; HP bar; Ability + Item rows;
  Nature / HP SP / SpD-or-Def SP / Rank tune boxes.

Side identity: sprite rings + badges (accent = you, danger = opponent), flat
surfaces — never tinted panel backgrounds (design-system rule).

## 4. New capabilities

**Per-move damage % — zero new computation.** `useDamageCalc` already returns
`DamageResult` for all four move slots of each side every render. The move list
renders `p1Results[i].minPercent`–`maxPercent` (and KO-chance text on the
active row); tapping a row dispatches `activeMoveIndex`; a small edit
affordance per row opens `ArenaMovePickerSheet` to change the slot.

**Scenario rows — `useDamageScenarios`.** New hook, called only inside the
landscape component (portrait/desktop pay nothing). For the **active move
only**, re-calls the existing pure mappers `mapToSmogonPokemon` /
`mapToSmogonMove` / `mapToSmogonField` + `calculateSmogonDamage` with modified
inputs, inside one `useMemo` keyed like `useDamageCalc`:

1. **Crit** — `isCrit: true` (multi-hit count preserved).
2. **Opp. max bulk** — defender with `spHp: 32` and `spDef`/`spSpd`: 32 on the
   move's defending stat, plus matching +nature (`boostedStat` override).
   Spread shapes follow `common-spreads.ts` (SP cap 32/stat, 66 total).
3. **Opp. no SP** — defender spread zeroed, neutral nature.

~3 extra sub-millisecond calcs per render; the existing code already runs 8
synchronous calcs per keystroke, so this changes no performance regime. If
profiling ever shows jank, `useDeferredValue` is the escape hatch — not built
now.

**Speed compare.**
- Your effective speed: existing `calculateStat(baseSpe, spSpe, natureMult,
  stage)` (`damage-calc.ts:12`), then a new ~5-line
  `effectiveSpeed(speed, { scarf, tailwind })` util in
  `src/features/damage-calculator/utils/speed.ts` applying ×1.5 / ×2 with
  floors (no scarf/tailwind speed math exists in the app today). Scarf is
  inferred from `item === 'Choice Scarf'`; tailwind from `isTailwind` in state.
- Opponent tiers: existing (currently unused) `calculateSpeedStats(baseSpeed)`
  (`src/features/pokemon/utils/stats.ts:23`) → Max+ / Max / Uninvested rows,
  plus scarf variants of Max+ and Max; each adjusted by the defender's known
  rank stages and tailwind from state.
- Badges: compare your effective speed to each tier — `Faster` (safe), `Tie`
  (field), `Outsped` (danger).

## 5. Interactions — reuse

| Component | Reuse mode |
|---|---|
| `ArenaPokemonPicker`, `ArenaItemPicker` | Content-only (verified container-agnostic); hosted in a `Sheet` by the landscape tree, same pattern as portrait; ability/nature inline lists lifted from `ArenaCalculator`'s shared Sheet wiring (~15 lines) into a small shared helper both trees use |
| `ArenaMovePickerSheet`, `ArenaAdvancedSheet` | As-is (self-wrapped bottom sheets). At 360px viewport height the 78vh cap ≈ 281px — cramped but functional; **accepted for v1**. Side-docked sheets are a possible follow-up |
| `ScanTeamModal`, `ShowdownImportModal` | Unchanged, page-level |

Nits handled: pickers' `autoFocus` disabled in landscape (soft keyboard would
cover most of the viewport) via an `autoFocus?: boolean` prop defaulting true.

## 6. Error handling & edges

- **No species selected:** panels render placeholder identity (as portrait
  does); center column shows an em-dash readout — no crashes on `null` results
  (`p1Results` slots are nullable already).
- **Unknown opponent data:** Item "Unknown", nature "—" render as plain values;
  scenario and speed math treat missing SP as 0 (matches state defaults).
- **Orientation flip mid-edit:** state lives at the page level and is
  unaffected; open Sheets stay open (Sheet is `position: fixed`) and remain
  usable in either orientation.
- **Light theme:** all styling uses Arena tokens; `data-theme='light'` works
  without additional code.

## 7. Testing

TDD, matching repo convention (vitest):

- `useViewportMode.test.ts` — matchMedia mock (prior art:
  `useIsMobile.test.ts`); asserts mode per viewport: 375×812 → arena,
  800×360 → arena-landscape, 1133×744 → arena-landscape (iPad mini landscape),
  744×1133 → arena (iPad mini portrait, width ≤ 767), 1280×800 → desktop.
- `speed.test.ts` — `effectiveSpeed` floors and stacking (scarf, tailwind,
  both).
- `useDamageScenarios.test.ts` — crit range > base range; max-bulk range <
  base range; no-SP ≥ base when defender had investment; null move → null
  scenarios.
- `arena-calculator-landscape.test.tsx` — renders with sample state: three
  panels present, four move rows show percent ranges, tapping a row changes
  active move, mode toggle switches damage↔speed views.
- Manual preview verification at 800×360 and 1133×744, portrait and desktop
  regression check at 375×812 / 1280×800.

## Out of scope (this step)

- Landscape layouts for Teams / EV-SP / Speed tiers (placeholder only).
- Side-docked sheet variant for landscape.
- "Record result" battle logging (the mock's button is not wired to a feature
  that exists; omit the button until the feature exists).
- Android floating-capture integration (separate deferred work stream).
- Speed-ability multipliers (Swift Swim etc.) in the speed compare — matches
  the existing speed-tiers feature, which also ignores them.
